## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### [Text Cleaning & Frequency Counter](#text-cleaning--frequency-counter)
**File:** `Text_cleaning_frequency_counter.ipynb`  
Implements fundamental text preprocessing steps (cleaning, tokenization, normalization) and builds a frequency distribution analyzer for words in a corpus.  
**Concepts:** Text preprocessing, regex, counting frequencies, data visualization.

### [Sentiment Analysis](#sentiment-analysis)
**File:** `Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb`  
Classifies text (e.g., product reviews) into positive or negative sentiments using traditional Machine Learning models.  
**Concepts:** Sentiment classification, bag-of-words, TF-IDF, scikit-learn.

### [Rule & Retrieval-Based Chatbot](#rule--retrieval-based-chatbot)
**File:** `Rule_and_Retrieval_Based_chatbot.ipynb`  
Builds a simple chatbot that responds to user queries using pre-defined rules and by retrieving answers from a knowledge base.  
**Concepts:** Rule-based systems, similarity matching, dialog systems.

### [Named Entity Recognition](#named-entity-recognition)
**File:** `Named_Entity_Recognition.ipynb`  
Identifies and classifies named entities (e.g., persons, organizations, locations) in text.  
**Concepts:** Sequence labeling, spaCy, information extraction.

### [Dictionary-Based Machine Translation](#dictionary-based-machine-translation)
**File:** `dictionary_based_machine_translation.ipynb`  
A basic translation system that translates words by performing a direct dictionary lookup. Highlights the challenges of naive translation.  
**Concepts:** Lexical translation, challenges of MT (idioms, word sense).

### [Character-Level Text Generation](#character-level-text-generation)
**File:** `Character_level_Text_Generation.ipynb`  
Generates new text character-by-character using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or LSTM model.  
**Concepts:** RNNs/LSTMs, text generation, deep learning.

### [Transformer-Based Machine Translation](#transformer-based-machine-translation)
**File:** `Transformer_Based_Machine_Translation.ipynb`  
Implements a state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) system using the Transformer architecture.  
**Concepts:** Transformer model, attention mechanism, seq2seq learning.
